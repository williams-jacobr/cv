          I am an enthusiastic self-taught student of front end development.
          <br />
          <br />
          During the course of 2021 I have finally seized the opportunity to do
          what I most loved when I was in college - code! I decided to take back
          the feeling I had throughout college and university - comfort and
          fulfilment from doing what I am great at. I cut back my hours as a
          teacher and dedicated my free time to courses on Javascript, CSS, and
          even some full-stack development to begin to understand how these
          languages fit into the bigger picture.
          <br />
          <br />
          I feel ready to and am enormously excited to get involved with a
          project or company. I am desperate to touch, to feel, to understand a
          real-world implementation of the skills which I have long wished I had
          been using ever since I left school.

          My first project away from any course or access to help and direction.
          My aim here is to build a space where people can learn about me, my
          interests, and keep up-to-date on the things which I am working on.
          This project showcases a number of techniques in JS and CSS, including
          an independently designed MVC architecture which makes use of ES6
          classes and asynchronous javascript. This project also taps into
          external APIs, including the github REST API and the Leaflet library.

        <h2 class="project_header">forkify</h2>
        <p>
          This project was the culmination of the techniques I learned through
          an online Javascript course on udemy.com.
          <br />
          <br />
          An application for users to search for recipes by keyword, modify the
          recipe ratios to their desired serving, create their own recipes
          (which are then pushed onto the external library), and bookmark
          favourites to be able to access them later. In this project I make use
          of many techniques including asynchronous Javascript, ES6 classes, and
          implementation of MVC architecture.
          <br />
          <br />
          This project marked a real step up in my approach to project
          implementation. Whether it be through a full analysis of which parts
          of the application are part of the model, the view, or the controller,
          or through making use of npm and external libraries, including
          bundlers, polyfillers, etc, the project pushed me to learn a range of
          skills. These skills opened my eyes to not just the processes needed
          to get a website up and running, but also to the hugh array of options
          available and possibilities to dive into.

        <h2 class="project_header">uHost</h2>
        <p>
          This project helped me to expand on my CSS skills, in order to be able
          to break away from templates supplied by online tutorials. In this
          course I learned how to work with flexbox, CSS grid, and SASS, along
          with a whole range of more traditional CSS techniques, as well as
          reactive design by making use of media queries.
          <br />
          <br />
          The application itself is a template of a server hosting service
          website. The design is very minimal and easy to navigate,
          demonstrating the use of transitions and animations to please the
          users eye and push the user towards CTAs.
